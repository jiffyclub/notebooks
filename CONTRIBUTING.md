Workflow
--------

Software Carpentry uses a development workflow similar to that of
[AstroPy][] and many other open source projects. The AstroPy docs have
excellent sections on:

* [Getting started with git][astropy-git]
* [Developer workflow][astropy-workflow]

About this Repo
---------------

The [IPython][] Notebooks in this repo are meant to be standalone documents
that can be used for self-guided learning. They should well organized and
contain discussion, explanation, and links to external documentation. All code
cells should be executed to show their output.
